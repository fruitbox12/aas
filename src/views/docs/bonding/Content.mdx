# How to Bond

To bond to a Provider’s Endpoint, users exchange ZAP for secondary tokens or DOTs based on the price point allotted by the Bonding Curve. You must first approve ZAP in order to bond.
 
1. Visit the Oracle or Token Marketplace

2. Find the Oracle or tokenized product/service you would like to subscribe to.

3. Click the “Bond” button for the desired Provider Endpoint.

4. Enter and review the transaction.

5. Click “Bond To Oracle”

6. Wait for approval of the transaction on the blockchain.

7. Once confirmed on the blockchain, you have successfully bonded your ZAP token and received your secondary token / DOT.
