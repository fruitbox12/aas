# How to Unbond

To Unbond from a Provider’s Endpoint, users sell their tokens or DOTs back to the Bonding Curve based on the price point displayed on the Bonding Curve.
 
1. To Unbond, you must already be Bonded to a Provider’s Endpoint.

2. Select “Filter by My Oracles/Tokens” in order to see which Endpoints you are Bonded to.

3. From the filtered list, select the Endpoint you desire to Unbond from.

4. Select the “Unbond” tab and enter an amount to unbond based on your balance and review your transaction.

5. Wait for approval of the transaction on the blockchain.

6. Once confirmed on the blockchain, you have successfully Unbonded and received ZAP token in exchange for the token/DOTs you previously held.
