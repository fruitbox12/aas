# Zap Frequently Asked Questions


## What is the Zap Protocol?

The Zap Protocol is a decentralized bonding curve curation market providing access to data providers and other services through algorithmic token generation.

The protocol provides developers numerous templates to easily build their decentralized applications (dapps). As well, oracles listed on the market can provide 
the valuable data needed for dapps either built on the Zap protocol or on another blockchain ecosystem to function.


## What is an Oracle?

An oracle is the means by which off-chain information can be fed into a smart contract or another decentralized application. They are a necessity for the 
functionality of decentralized products which are dependent on off-chain data. Oracles are capable of actuating autonomous economic activity on the blockchain. 


## What is the Oracle Problem?

The greatest issue holding back the adoption and scalability of smart contracts has been the lack of choice and availability of relevant oracles for real-world 
data feeds. This has been called the “oracle problem” as this lack of choice in data leaves smart contracts vulnerable to malicious attacks by bad actors who would 
benefit by feeding false information into a smart contract. 


## What is the Solution?

While many have attempted to create a ‘more perfect oracle,’ Zap created a decentralized marketplace to encourage the creation of new oracles and the curation of 
existing ones. Using a multi-party oracle, developers can aggregate data from multiple sources in order to ensure any bad actors / bad data are algorithmically 
eliminated as outliers. As well, the utility of bonding curve technology provides the decentralized world an indicator as to how valuable the oracle is (more on this below).

Ultimately, Zap is not in competition with existing oracles but rather provides a protocol where oracles such as these can exist and compete for subscribers. 
This approach offers the choice and trust needed to advance the adoption of smart contracts and decentralized applications. A competitive marketplace of oracles 
that are both useful for subscribers and profitable for service (data) providers is the best approach to this problem. 


## What is a Bonding Curve?

A bonding curve is a smart contract which acts as an algorithmic market maker offering full liquidity based on a predetermined and immutable pricing structure. 
In fact, the Zap protocol is credited with coining the term “bonding curve.” 

The price is determined by how much Zap is staked in the contract. Anytime someone bonds, they lock their Zap and receive a secondary token redeemable 
for the service or product provided. As well, the secondary token can be sold back at the contract for the price determined by the smart contract based 
on the amount of pooled Zap. Once redeemed or sold back to the contract, the secondary token is burned and the price will adjust as such. If the secondary 
token is redeemed  the service provider receives a payment of Zap from the Smart Contract and the secondary token is burned. If the secondary token is 
traded back to the smart contract, the service subscriber will receive Zap and the secondary token will be burned. The cost of the service can be greater 
than or less than when you originally bonded to the bonding curve. 

This following is a simple example of a x<sup>2</sup> bonding curve.

## What’s Bonding?

In order to interact with a specific oracle using the Zap Protocol, you must first bond Zap tokens to that oracle, locking that Zap in a pool and 
producing a number of secondary tokens dependent on the predetermined algorithmic price at any given time. In the specific case of data, the templates 
for developers produce an oracle-specific token which is non-transferable, non-divisible, and worth one query of data. Other use-cases allow you to 
trade the secondary ERC20 token outside the bonding curve smart contract which issued it and trade on other exchanges or use the token outside the Zap protocol.

An oracle’s creator sets the supply/price function which then gives users the ability to discover and gravitate towards bonding variables that 
incentivize truth and profit. As more users bond Zap to a specific oracle, the price of that individual oracle’s secondary token will follow its
predetermined pricing curve. This is a distributed form of reputation which is part of the way the Zap protocol solves the oracle problem, as described above. 


## What’s Unbonding?

Users can, at any time, redeem their secondary token for the product or service being provided or trade it back to the bonding curve smart contract 
for Zap at the current exchange rate. Both of these scenarios are called unbonding. This technology, moreover, rewards early adopters of valuable oracles 
as they can now redeem the service bought at a lower price than what others pay or can trade the secondary token back to the smart contract bonding curve 
for more Zap than was originally bonded. 


## Bringing it all together

In short, the Zap/secondary token bonding curve mechanism is designed to attract users to the protocol by incentivizing service providers to populate an 
emerging ecosystem with new oracles, incentivizing speculators to fund oracles they predict will be useful in the future, and ultimately curating a rich and 
dynamic field of oracles along with decentralized applications for subscribers to choose from.

The bonding curve acts as a decentralized exchange with full liquidity as the price is preset and determined by the amount of Zap bonded to the contract. 
The bonding curve smart contract is the algorithmic market maker which facilitates any of the trades or redeeming of services.

Not only does this solve the oracle problem, but it also offers the emerging web3 world a protocol that it can build and grow on. For example, the world 
is pushing for the tokenization of everything and yet, this is not possible when centralized exchanges ask for exorbitant listing fees / volume requirements 
and current decentralized exchanges lack liquidity on traditional buy/sell order books. As well, many tokenized assets might only have a handful of 
non-fungible tokens created making it that much more difficult to find or establish a market. 


Due to the bonding curve, however, the Zap protocol offers a fully liquid decentralized exchange in which the world can instantly buy, sell, and redeem 
products and services in a peer-to-peer network. 


## What are some use cases?

Here is a few of the use cases possible using the Zap protocol: 

- Data (oracle) monetization
- Issue a new ERC20
- Create a DAO
- Decentralized Competitions
- Fundraising
- Development Bounties
- Tokenization of Property
- Tradable Futures Market
- Zap Wrapped Token


## What are some partnerships?
As of July 2020, Zap has officially announced partnerships with the following companies and projects:

- CoinGecko
- Cafe Joe USA
- BitUnits
- Howdoo
- Energy Ledger
- JuJu Rental

Many are in the works and in the process of becoming official. Check back for an updated list.


## What Blockchain does Zap Operate on?

The protocol was first developed on the ethereum blockchain but has since been expanded to work with the EOS blockchain as well. 
We continue to explore additional blockchains in which to provide compatibility with the Zap protocol.


## How is Zap different from other projects?

While we do not like to compare ourselves directly to any other projects, we can speak to who we are. We built a fully 
decentralized and permissionless protocol which we believe will lead to the “killer Dapp” as it offers so much versatility in 
its utilization of oracles, bonding curves, and smart contract templates.

## What is the difference between chainlink & zap?
_[Copy of Ben Gravis' answer from the official Discord]_: Zap's token has utility unlike chainlink. Zap is an ecosystem for companies, 
retailers, artists or just normal citizens to create tokens & oracles. These can be made in a couple of minutes. You can instantly sell 
them through their decentralized exchange. Each token or oracle is based on a predefined pricing curve named Bonding Curve. When creating 
your token/oracle you set your own pricing curve, just drag n drop. Your token/oracle starts with 0 supply. When someone buys supply 
gets created and price moves along your price function. When someone sells, supply gets burned and price move lower along the pricing curve. 
This mechanism eliminates market makers & the need for liquidity. Which are both a huge problem in the markets right now! The advantage 
for holding zap now is when people start using the platform the value of zap will rise due to adoption of the ecosystem. To create, use & 
trade these tokens & oracles people have to buy zap. When you exchange your zap for a particular token/oracle your zap will be sent to a pool. 
This could lead to an even lower circulating supply which can boost the price even more. Price will move up due to adoption/usage of the 
infrastructure & not because of price speculation like Link and 90% of all other tokens. The oracles via zap can be implemented in smart 
contracts & dapps. You will be able to trade data like you're trading cryptocurrencies right now. I could go on and on, with zap there are 
unlimited possibilities.
