# Zap Protocol User Guide


##  Zap Protocol Overview

In 2019, Zap Protocol released the first live decentralized Oracle platform on ethereum mainnet. Since that time Zap Protocol has progressively developed Oracles and Bonding Curve technology matched with smart contract templates so anyone can quickly execute their DeFi use-cases. 

Zap Protocol is credited with coining the industry accepted term, “bonding curve.” Originally created as a solution to the “oracle problem” (Zap Protocol enables a robust decentralized data marketplace and developed the Multi-Party Oracle which aggregates data from many oracles and determines an outcome based on consensus), we continued development to expand possibilities and accessibility with more smart contract templates matched with an intuitive interface. 

There is no node-approval process or third-party intermediaries to use the platform. Zap Protocol is open source software that lowers the barrier to entry for listing and accessing tokenized products and service.

The Synapse Foundation located in Zugg, Switzerland oversees Zap Protocol’s long-term budget. The foundation works to ensure Zap Protocol remains decentralized, up-to-date, and maintained. \

Zap Protocol seeks to fulfil three main objectives within the blockchain ecosystem: 

**Build a Robust, Source Agnostic Oracle Network**

* Zap is bringing together the existing wealth of global data with the diverse capabilities of distributed applications by ensuring the secure creation of oracles.

**Incentivize Oracle Creation and Curation**

* Zap is building a global, decentralized data marketplace and populating it with unique incentivization tools, empowering anyone to begin monetizing their data.

**Fuel the Next Generation of Embedded Dapps**

* Zap is supplying a much-needed fundamental piece of the Ethereum ecosystem and the Web 3.0 paradigm, enabling developers to construct Dapps that simply could not function without it. We seek to further empower the decentralized internet with a growing stack integration.

## Zap Protocol Terms

**Bonding Curve**


This image above displays a basic x² bonding curve. The curve represents the immutable price that is created by the provider issuing the service or product before launching. It is along this curve that the secondary-token’s price is reflected. More specifically, the X-axis represents the ZAP pool balance and the Y-axis represents the Secondary Token’s price. So as more ZAP is pooled, based on the Bonding Curve above, the price for the Secondary Token will increase at an exponential rate. The Zap Bonding Curve Initializer provides for drag and drop capabilities when customizing your pricing index.


**Bonding**

Bonding is a process whereby an individual locks their ZAP token to a service-specific bonding curve smart contract pool in order to receive a redeemable secondary token or subtoken. Prior to bonding ZAP tokens, individuals will be able to see how many secondary tokens or sub tokens they will receive as a result of bonding. Individuals are able to purchase as many tokens as they are able to afford based on the predetermined pricing index. 

**Unbonding**

Unbonding is when a user redeems their secondary token or subtoken or when a user sells those tokens back to the bonding curve smart contract for ZAP. Both situations would result in lowering the overall pool of ZAP and thus lowers the price of the Secondary Token or Subtoken for the next individual who Bonds.

**Provider**

The individuals and companies that list tokenized products and services on the Zap Platform are referred to as Providers. To use the Zap Protocol smart contract templates, Providers will select an ethereum account to act as their provider identifier, an IPFS key pair, and define their immutable bonding curve pricing index.

**Subscriber (User / Consumer)**

A subscriber is a user / consumer of any of the Zap Platform's tokenized products or services. To become a Subscriber, a user must bond ZAP to a Provider’s curve. The subscriber will then be given a secondary token or subtoken which can be used to redeem the services associated with the Bonding Curve’s Endpoint. Subscribers can also unbond their secondary tokens or subtokens from the Bonding Curve to receive back ZAP based on the price displayed by the bonding curve. 

**Endpoint**

An Endpoint represents the tokenized product or service you will receive when redeeming your secondary token or subtoken. Providers can deploy any Endpoint to the Zap Platform to provide data and other tokenized products and services.

**Subtoken (DOTS)**

‘DOTS’ are sub-tokens used within specific smart contract templates on the Zap Oracles Ecosystem. These templates are typically used for Oracles creation or subscriptions services. The ZAP Token is used to purchase a smart contract subtoken referred to as “DOTS” by bonding to the Provider’s Endpoint. DOTS can have an array of functions depending on the Endpoint service. Some of the functionalities of DOTs are:

* Query an Oracle's Endpoint for a data feed: 1 DOT = 1 Query

* Start a subscription service with an Endpoint: 1 DOT = 1 Block Time

* Speculate on the future price of a service provider's DOT(s) by holding and selling the DOT(s) back for Zap, rather than redeeming the DOT

* DOT(s) can not be traded or moved outside the Zap Smart Contract that issues them.

* DOT(s) are indivisble

**Secondary Tokens**

Secondary Tokens are provider specific tokens that are issued by specific bonding curve smart contract templates. Unlike DOTS, the Secondary Tokens issued are based on different ethereum token standards and can be moved or traded outside the Zap Smart Contracts that issue them. 

**Oracles**

Smart contracts are designed to execute on a curtain set of terms and conditions in a trustless and transparent manner. However, smart contracts face a dilemma in their inability to communicate with off-chain data. Smart contracts require oracles to feed them this off-chain data in order to trigger economic activity autonomously on the blockchain.
