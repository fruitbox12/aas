# TopBar (Home Page)

<br />

## Uses

Serves as the top navigation bar on the home page. <br />

## Expected Behavior

Shows the full logo and links in a wide viewport. Otherwise shows only the icon logo and hides links in a hamburger menu.

## Rendered Example

[Must go to stories to see the rendering.](layouts-main-layout-top-bar--alpha) <br />
This component is mounted onto MUI's `AppBar` which has a fixed position relative to the viewport. 
The canvas will not expand to show this component.
