# Expanded Oracle Market

<br />

## Uses

This is the page the user goes to view potential oracles to bond to.

## Children Components

`Page` from `src/components/Page.js` wraps the whole view. <br />
`Header` from `src/views/endpointwizard/header.js` serves as visual sugar for page navigation. <br />
`PerformanceCard` from `src/components/marketplacecomponents/performancecards` tos display the uder's balances. <br />
`EndpointCard` from `src/components/endpointcard.js` to dispaly the oracles in a card view. <br />
`OracleEndptListCard` from `src/components/oracleendptlistcard.js` to dispaly the oracles in a tabular view.

## Implementation

Serves as a view for the Oracle Marketpalce with different ways to view the oracles. <br />
Follows the format followed by the other dashboard views:

-  The whole view is wrapped by a `Page` component.
-  A Material UI `Container` wraps everything inside `Page`.
-  A `Header` specific to this view is at the top of the page.
-  There's a Material UI `Paper` component serving as a background.
