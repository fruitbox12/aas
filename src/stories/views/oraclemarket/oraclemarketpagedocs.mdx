# Oracle Market

<br />

## Uses

This is the page the user goes to view potential oracles to bond to.

## Children Components

`Page` from `src/components/Page.js` wraps the whole view. <br />
`Header` from `src/views/endpointwizard/header.js` serves as visual sugar for page navigation. <br />
`OracleMarketTable` from `src/stories/components/oraclemarkettable` is the component the user interacts with to view listed oracles.

## Implementation

Serves as a view for the dashboard. <br />
Follows the format followed by the other dashboard views:

-  The whole view is wrapped by a `Page` component.
-  A Material UI `Container` wraps everything inside `Page`.
-  A `Header` specific to this view is at the top of the page.
-  The "main component" (in this case the `OracleMarketView`) is wrapped in a Material UI `Box`.
-  There's a Material UI `Paper` component serving as a background.

## Expected Behavior

Should only be accessible once the user in confirmed to have "logged in" using some W3 provider / enabled Ethereum wallet.
Should be mobile responsive (aka stays user friendly despite viewport size)
