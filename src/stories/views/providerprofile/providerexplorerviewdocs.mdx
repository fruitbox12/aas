# Oracle Provider View

<br />

## Uses

This page allows the user to see relevant information concerning the oracle that they have selected, including:

-  The oracle's address
-  The oracle's name
-  The number of endpoints provided
-  Each endpoints they provide

## Children Components

`Page` from `src/components/Page.js` wraps the whole view. <br />
`Header` from `src/views/endpointwizard/header.js` serves as visual sugar for page navigation. <br />
`NameCard` from `src/components/namecard.js` to dispaly the oracle's name. <br />
`ProviderDetailsCard` from `src/components/providerdetailscard.js` to display information regarding the specific oracle. <br />
`EndpointCard` from `src/components/endpointcard.js` to dispaly informatiopn regarding the individual endpoints provided.

## Implementation

Follows the format followed by the other dashboard views:

-  The whole view is wrapped by a `Page` component.
-  A Material UI `Container` wraps everything inside `Page`.
-  A `Header` specific to this view is at the top of the page.b
-  There's a Material UI `Paper` component serving as a background.

## Expected Behavior

Should only be accessible once the user in confirmed to have "logged in" using some W3 provider / enabled Ethereum wallet. <br/>
Accessible by the user selecting a specific oracle to view through the marketpalce. <br/>
With viewports smaller than MUI's `md` the options to bond are hidden.
