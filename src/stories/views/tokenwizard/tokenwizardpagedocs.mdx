# New Token Wizard

<br />

## Uses

This is page the user goes to for listing a new token for the ZAP marketpalce.

# Below Content has not been editted from original file

## Children Components

`Page` from `src/components/Page.js` wraps the whole view. <br />
`Header` from `src/views/endpointwizard/header.js` serves as visual sugar for page navigation. <br />
`Wizard` from `src/views/endpointwizard/wizard` is the component the user interacts with to list a new oracle end point


## Implementation

Serves as a view for the dashboard. <br />
Follows the format followed by the other dashboard views: 
- The whole view is wrapped by a `Page` component.
- A Material UI `Container` wraps everything inside `Page`.
- A `Header` specific to this view is at the top of the page.
- The "main component" (in this case the `Wizard`) is wrapped in a Material UI `Box`.
- There's a Material UI `Paper` component serving as a background.

## Expected Behavior

Should only be accessible once the user in confirmed to have "logged in" using some W3 provider / enabled Ethereum wallet.
Should be mobile responsive (aka stays user friendly despite viewport size)
