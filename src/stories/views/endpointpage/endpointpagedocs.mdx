# Endpoint Page

<br />

## Uses

This is page lets the user to see more details concerning a specific endpoint by an Oracle.

## Children Components

`Page` from `src/components/Page.js` wraps the whole view. <br />
`Header` from `src/views/endpointwizard/header.js` serves as visual sugar for page navigation. <br />
`MarkdownViewer` from `src/components/markdownviewer.js` allows the user to easily view the markdown file associated with the endpoint. <br />
`CodeViewer` from `src/components/codeviewer.js` allows the user to easily view the JSON Schema of the endpoint. <br />

## Implementation

Serves as a view for the dashboard. <br />
Follows the format followed by the other dashboard views:

-  The whole view is wrapped by a `Page` component.
-  A Material UI `Container` wraps everything inside `Page`.
-  A `Header` specific to this view is at the top of the page.
-  There's a Material UI `Paper` component serving as a background.

## Expected Behavior

Should only be accessible once the user in confirmed to have "logged in" using some W3 provider / enabled Ethereum wallet. <br />
For desktop viewport sizes, the top of the page is split between the bonding curve and current stats of the end point. <br />
For mobile viewport sizes, all of the components fall into a single column. <br />
