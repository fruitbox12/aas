# User in the Redux Store

## Storage Method

Stored as a object such that:

```JavaScript
{
      address: string,
      provider: boolena,
      bondedTo: object of BondedOracle,
      ethBalance: number,
      zapBalance: number,
}
```

Each key in `bondedTo` corresponds to a endpoint's address.
Each value corresponds to an instantiated BondedOracle.

## To Access

```JavaScript
const allOracles = useSelector((state) => state.user.user);
```

NB: Need to remove old user reducer for this

## Actions to Dispatch

Found in `src/actions/oracleactions.js`

| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connectUser`      | `CONNECT_USER`       | Called when the user is attmepting to connect their wallet to the Dapp for access             |
| `getWallet`        | `GET_WALLET`         | Gets the contents of the active wallet                                                        |
| `getBondedOracles` | `GET_BONDED_ORACLES` | Get a list or oracles the active wallet is bonded to and how many dots they have for each one |
| `endSession`       | `END_SESSION`        | Called when logging out of the Dapp to clear session data                                     |

## Action Descriptions

All of the following return an object of:

```JavaScript
{
    type,
    payload,
}
```

| field     | type   | description                                                              |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`    | string | Used to distinguish what actions are being performed on the redux store. |
| `payload` |        | The changes to add to / override the store depending on the reducer/     |

### CONNECT_USER

The `payload` is an object of the connect wallet's address as a string.

The reducer adds it to the `user` object in the store.

### GET_WALLET

The `payload` is an object of 2 numbers: the ETH balance and the ZAP balance.

The reducer adds it to the `user` object in the store.

### GET_BONDED_ORACLES

The `payload` is array of `BondedOracle` objects created from processing query results from the blockchain.

The reducer iterates through the returned array to add to the store as an object since each endpoint would have a unique address that can act as a key, similar to how the oracles are stored.

### END_SESSION

The `payload` is null.

The reducer reverts the `user` field of the store to the initial state.
