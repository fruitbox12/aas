# Oracles in the Redux Store

## Storage Method

Stored as a object such that:

```JavaScript
{
    endpointAddress: object of Oracle,
    .
    .
    .
}
```

Each key corresponds to the concatenation of the Oracles address and the endpoint name.
Each value corresponds to an instantiated Oracle object.

## To Access

```JavaScript
const allOracles = useSelector((state) => state.oracles.oracles);
```

| `getOracles`   | `GET_ORACLES`   | Called to query the blockchain for all available Zap oracles to store locally |
| `clearOracles` | `CLEAR_ORACLES` | Forces the store to dump all data concerning oracles from the store           |

## Action Descriptions

All of the following return an object of:

```JavaScript
{
    type,
    payload,
}
```

| `type`    | string   | Used to distinguish what actions are being performed on the redux store. |
| `payload` | not null | The changes to add to / override the store depending on the reducer/     |

### GET_ORACLES

The `payload` is an array of `Oracle` objects created from processing query results from the blockchain.

The reducer iterates through the returned array to add to the store since each endpoint would have a unique address that can act as a key. 

### CLEAR_ORACLES

The `payload` is an empty array of `Oracle` objects.

The reducer just does a repalcement of the current store with an empty array to clear it.
