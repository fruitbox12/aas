# Add Provider Modal

<br />

## Uses

This component informs the user that they need a Web3 provider.

## Implementation

### Props Required

```JavaScript
props = {
   className,
   open,
   handleClose
}
```

### Symbols to Note

| Variable      | Type     | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `className`   | string   | Custom className for sizing and positioning                             |
| `open`        | boolean  | Path to the markdown file to display                                    |
| `handleClose` | function | A call back function that sets `open` to false so that the modal closes |

## Expected Behavior

View is restriced to MUI's `sm` size since there is not that much content to be shown.
