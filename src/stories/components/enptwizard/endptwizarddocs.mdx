# New Endpoint Wizard

<br />

## Uses

This is the component the user interacts with to list a new oracle for the ZAP marketpalce.
Contains all of the logic of the wizrd

## Children Components

`WizardView` from `src/views/endpointwizard/wizardview.js` handles the UI of the wizard.

## Implementation

### Initial `state`

How the wizard stores the necessary data

```JavaScript
this.state = {
    step: 0,
    builder: 0,
    done: 0,
    emptyProvider: false,
    emptyEndpoint: false,
    invalidArray: false,
    provider: "",
    endpoint: "",
    markdownLink: "",
    jsonLink: "",
    curveArray: [],
    arrayErrorMsg: "",
}
```

For Storybook purposes so that the state can be influenced

```JavaScript
    this.state = {
        ...this.state,
        ...props.state,
    };
```

<br />

### The `Wizard`'s State

| Field of `this.state` | What it controls                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `step`                | Controls which screen of the wizard to show                                                         |
| `builder`             | Controls which curve initializer to show when `step===2`                                            |
| `done`                | Controls how far forward the user can jump between steps if they want to go back to a previous step |
| `emptyProvider`       | Boolean if the "Provider Name" field should be in an `error` state                                  |
| `emptyEndpoint`       | Boolean if the "Endpoint Name" field should be in an `error` state                                  |
| `invalidArray`        | Boolean if the "Argument Array" field should be in an `error` state                                 |
| `provider`            | String of the name of the provider (active wallet)                                                  |
| `endpoint`            | String of the name of the oracle to list on ZAP                                                     |
| `markdownLink`        | String of the link to the markdown file of the oracle                                               |
| `jsonLink`            | String of the link to the JSON schema of the oracle                                                 |
| `curveArray`          | Array of numbers in the format needed to instantiate a bonding curve                                |
| `arrayErrorMsg`       | String of the error encountered when parsing the `curveArray` from string to array of numbers       |

`step`

-  0: Oracle endpoint details
-  1: Choose a curne initializer
-  2: Initialize the curve using the selected initializer
-  3: Confirm all details before submitting to the blockchain
   <br />

`builder`

-  0: No initializer was chosen yet
-  1: Visual initializer using drag to draw
-  2: Argumentive curve initializer using a manual input array
   <br />

## Expected Behavior

### Step 1: Add Oracle Endpoint Details

The initial state should be:

```JavaScript
this.state = {
    step: 0,
    builder: 0,
    done: 0,
    emptyProvider: false,
    emptyEndpoint: false,
    invalidArray: false,
    provider: "",
    endpoint: "",
    markdownLink: "",
    jsonLink: "",
    curveArray: [],
    arrayErrorMsg: "",
}
```

... unless the Zap Dapp detects the current active account is a proivder.
In that case, the `provider` field should be autopopulated and locked. <br />
If the `Next` button is pressed

-  While `provider` (`Provider Name` field) and `endpoint` (`Endpoint Name` field) are empty, then the fields on the user interface
   should turn red for the user's attention, and not move to the next page.
-  When the `provider` and `endpoint` are provided, then the wizard moves to the next screen.

### Step 2: Choose a Curve Initializer

The user is prompted for how they prefer to instantiate their bonding curve.

### Step 3: Initialize the Curve Using the Selected Initializer

The user creates their bonding curve using the initializer they selected.
After this step, thge initializer setting is "locked in". Jumping between pages should not change which initializer is used, unless
they go to step 2 and choose another one.

#### Visual Curve Initializer (Drag to Edit)

Shows the bezier cuve with draggable points. Presets are shown on the side of the graph.

#### Argument Curve Initializer (Type in Array)

Shows a blank graph at first. Graph updates as the entered array is parsed. <br />
If the `Next` button is pressed

-  While the entered array doesn't follow the proper format in the docs, then the field on the user interface
   should turn red for the user's attention, and not move to the next page.
-  When the array entered follows the proper formatting, then the wizard moves to the next screen.

### Step 4: Confirm All Details Before Submitting to the Blockchain

This is the final screen before the web3 call are made. The user confirms all the details of their oracle listing including the:

-  Provider Name
-  Endpoint Name
-  Link to the JSON Schema
-  Link to the markdownLink
-  Bonding curve
