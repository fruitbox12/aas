# Choose Curve Builder

<br />

## Use

This component allows the user to select how they would like to initialize their bonding curve.

## Implementation

Takes in the function that allows the user to change the curve builder (`ChangeBuilder` in the `Wizard`). <br />
Logic is handled by the parent `Wizard` component. This is only a view.

## Expected Behavior

The only way to move forward is to make a selection.

## Rendered Example

[In the `Wizard`](/?path=/story/components-endpoint-wizard-full-wizard--beta)

<Canvas>
   <Story id={"components-endpoint-wizard-full-wizard--beta"} />
</Canvas>
