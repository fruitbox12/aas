# Oracle Endpoint Details

<br />

## Uses

This component allows the user to input information relative to their oracle to be listed.

## Implementation

Takes in a callback function to pass updates the state in the `Wizard` and displays that information in 
the provided text fields. <br />
Accessible and editable fields:

| In the `Wizard`'s state | Field in the UI | 
|---|---|
| provider| Provider Name | 
| endpoint | Endpoint Name | 
| markdownLink | Link to Markdown file | 
| jsonLink | Link to JSON Schema | 

## Expected Behavior

This is the first page of the wizard. <br />
If the Dapp detects that the active account is already a provider, that field is auto-populated.

## Rendered Example

[In the `Wizard`](/?path=/story/components-endpoint-wizard-full-wizard--alpha)

<Canvas>
   <Story id={"components-endpoint-wizard-full-wizard--alpha"} />
</Canvas>
