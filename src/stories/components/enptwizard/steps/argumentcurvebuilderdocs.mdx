# Argument Curve Builder

<br />

## Uses

This component allows the user to manually input the coefficient array to create their desired bonding curve.

## Children Components

`BezierCurve` _component file location tbd_

## Implementation

Takes in the coefficient array (`curveArray` in the `Wizard`) and displays the rendered curve using the `BezierCurve`
component. <br />
Logic is handled by the parent `Wizard` component. This is only a view. <br />
Accessible and editable fields:

| In the `Wizard`'s state | Field in the UI | 
|---|---|
| curveArray | Argument Array | 


## Expected Behavior


Only accessible if the user chooses to use this builder.
Empty arrays produce no curve.
Only a valid array lets the user move to the next page

## Rendered Example

[In the `Wizard`](/?path=/story/components-endpoint-wizard-full-wizard--delta)
<Canvas>
   <Story id={"components-endpoint-wizard-full-wizard--delta"} />
