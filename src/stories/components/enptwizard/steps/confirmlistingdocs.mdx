# Confirm Listing

<br />

## Use

This component allows the user to finalize and all the details of their oracle before submitting their bonding curve
to the blockchain.

## Children Components

`BezierCurve` _component file location tbd_

## Implementation

Takes in all the data stored in `Wizard` to display it to the user <br />
_Most_ of the logic is handled by the parent `Wizard` component. Array conversion into a human readable string is done here
to prevent unecessary function calls.

## Expected Behavior

Can only be reached once all previous steps are completed. Is accessible only if all of the provided data in the previous
steps is valid. <br />
None of the data is editable at this screen.

## Rendered Example

</Canvas>

[In the `Wizard` when the user used the argument initializer](/?path=/story/components-endpoint-wizard-full-wizard--zeta)

<Canvas>
