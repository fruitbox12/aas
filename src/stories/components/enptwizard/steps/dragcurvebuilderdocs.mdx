# Drag Curve Builder

<br />

## Uses

This component allows the user to input the coefficient array by dragging a bezier curve to create their desired bonding curve.

## Children Components

`BezierCurve` _component file location tbd_

## Implementation

Takes in a callback function (`handleDragCurve` in the `Wizard`) to pass updates the state in the `Wizard` and displays
the rendered curve using the `BezierCurve` component. <br />
Logic is handled by the parent `Wizard` component. This is only a view. <br />
Accessible and editable fields:

| In the `Wizard`'s state | Field in the UI | 
|---|---|
| curveArray | the `BezierCurve` | 

## Expected Behavior

Only accessible if the user chooses to use this builder. <br />
Produces a default positive linear curve.

## Rendered Example
