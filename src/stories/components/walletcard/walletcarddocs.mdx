# Wallet Card

<br />

## Uses

This appears in the dashboard so that the user can see their ZAP portfolio break down in a visually intuitive way.

## Children Components

Imports the pie chart breakdown from `src/components/walletcard/walletchart.js`. <br />
Imports the modal to show the ETH wallet QR code from `src/components/walletcard/qrmodal.js`. <br />

## Implementation

### Props Required

All of which should be provided by some node query from the parent through a web3 connection.

```JavaScript
props = {
    address,    // The active ETH wallet address
    dots,       // The amount of DOTs in the active address
    eth,        // The amount of ETH in the active address
    zap         // The amount of ZAP in the active address
}
```

Upon mounting, there's an API call to CoinGecko using `useZapPrices()` from `src/api/zapconversions.js`. <br />

## Expected Behavior

Clicking the truncated address under the pie char copies `address` to the users' system's clipboard. <br />
The CoinGecko API should be called every so often so that prices are updated close to real-time. <br />
Pressing the button with `Send Tokens`, `Get QR Code`, and `Get ZAP` should open the appropriate modals. <br />
Fluid to parent container but can be overridden by parent styles and custom `className` <br />
