# Beta Warning Dialog

<br />

## Uses

This component is a disclaimer stating that the current state of the dApp might not be the most secure. Continuation is at the user's discretion

```JavaScript

   className,
   open,
   handleClose
}
```

### Symbols to Note

| Variable      | Type     | Purpose                                           |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `className`   | string   | Custom className for sizing and positioning       |

| `handleClose` | function | Callback function for hwo the dialog should close |

## Expected Behavior

View is fluid. Restriced only by being palced within a container in a HOC. <br />
There's two buttons, one to continue to the new UI, the other leads to the legacy UI. <br />
Going to the old UI happens in another tab and nothing else happens in the new UI besides continued loading. <br />
Accepting the risks allows the user to continue interacting with the dApp. <br />
The user must click on a button to interact.
