# Code Viewer

<br />

## Uses

This component allows the user to view things such as code or endpoint JSON schema in a typical monospaced font

## Implementation

### Props Required

```JavaScript
props = {
   className,
   code,
}
```

### Symbols to Note

| Variable    | Type   | Purpose                                     |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `className` | string | Custom className for sizing and positioning |
| `name`      | string | The code to dispaly                         |

## Expected Behavior

View is fluid. Restriced only by being palced within a container in a HOC. <br />
The code wraps so that there is no horizontal overflow or need for a scroll bar. <br />
If nothing displayable is passed through `file`, `None provided` is shown. <br />
