# MArkdown Viewer

<br />

## Uses

This component allows the user to view markdown in a user friendly format.

## Implementation

### Props Required

```JavaScript
props = {
   className,
   file,
}
```

### Symbols to Note

| Variable    | Type   | Purpose                                     |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `className` | string | Custom className for sizing and positioning |
| `file`      | string | Path to the markdown file to display        |

## Expected Behavior

View is fluid. Restriced only by being palced within a container in a HOC. <br />
Markdown should render in the same way as it does in the docs pages. <br /> 
If nothing displayable is passed through `file`, `None provided` is shown.
