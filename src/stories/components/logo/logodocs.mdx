# ZAP Logo

<br />

## Uses

The ZAP Logo appears in the navigation bars of the splash screen and dashboard.

## Implementation

Imports the png logo from `public/static/images`. <br/>
Uses Material UI's `isWidthUp` to see if the view port is wide enough to support the full logo with text. <br/>
Uses Material UI's `useTheme` to see if the theme used has `pallette.type` of `dark` or `light`. <br/>

## Expected Behavior

### Based on Viewport

While the view port is at least `md` (`960px`) wide, the full logo is displayed. <br/>
While the view port is at smaller than `md`, the icon-only logo is displayed. <br/>

### Based on Theme Type

While the current `pallette.type` is `dark`, the logo with light text will render. <br/>
While the current `pallette.type` is `light`, the logo with dark text will render. <br/>

## Renderings

### `lg` viewport with a `light` type theme

<Canvas>
   <img height={"50px"} src={require("public/static/darkzaplogo.png")} />
</Canvas>

### `lg` viewport with a `dark` type theme

<Canvas style={{background: '#000000'}}>
   <img height={"50px"} src={require("public/static/lightzaplogo.png")} />
</Canvas>

### `md` viewpoert on any theme type

<Canvas>
   <img height={"50px"} src={require("public/static/zaplogo.png")} />
</Canvas>
