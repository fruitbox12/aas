### Enums

For the transaction type:

```JavaScript
actions = {
   BOND: "Bond",
   UNBOND: "Unbond",
};
```

For error messages:

```JavaScript
errorMsg = {
   ALPHANUM:
      "Please enter positive whole number values only.",
   OVERLIMIT:
      "The amunt you are trying to bond to is over the Dot Limit of this endpoint's bonding curve.",
   OVERBONDED:
      "The amount you are trying to unbond is over the amount of Dots you are currently bonded to.",
   EMPTY:
      "Please enter a positive whole number values.",
};
```

### State Objects

For the transaction type:

```JavaScript
mode     // A string from `actions`
```

For the transaction values:

```JavaScript
tsxVals = {
   zap,     // Zap cost to bond -OR- Zap to be withdrawn
   dots,    // Dots to bond -OR- unbond
}
```

For error handling:

```JavaScript
inputInvalid = {
   err,     // true => there's an invalid input   false => the transaction is valid
   msg,     // A string from `errorMsg`
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### Rendering

The root container is fluid. Restriced only by being palced within a container in a HOC. <br />
On desktop sized viewports, it will render as 2 columns with the curve data on the left and transaction data on the right. <br />
On mobile size viewports, it renders as a single column with the components on the left on top and the right on the bottome. <br />

#### Either transaction

The bond/un bond button will appear in the active palette's primary color (`theme.palette.primary.main`) with the custom bond icon.
When an error is trigerred:
- the bond/unbond button will be disabled.
- the input field will be red with the appropriate error message from `errorMsg` displayed nearby.

#### When Bonding

The Zap calculated for the transaction will show `Zap to Bond`. <br />
The bond/unbond button will show `Bond to Oracle` <br />

#### When Unonding

The Zap calculated for the transaction will show `Zap form Unbond`. <br />
The bond/unbond button will show `Unbond from Oracle` <br />

### Data Access

Relies on the redux store to retrive the appropriate information concerning the endpoint. <br/>
Uses the `oracleAddress` and `endpointName` props to find the appropriate object in the store. <br/>

### Input Validation

Inputs are processed by `handleChangeDots`, which uses `setTsxVals`, `setInInvalid`,`withinDotLimit`,and `withinDotsOwned`. <br />

#### Either Transaction

User input cannot be blank. Blank input results in an error showing the message in `errorMsg.EMPTY`. <br />
User input has to be a whole positive number. Any other inputs result in an error showing the message in `errorMsg.ALPHANUM`. <br />

#### When Bonding

User input cannot cause the total number of dots to be bonded after the transaction be greater than the `Dot Limit`. <br />
If the `Dot Limit` is potentially surpassed, the error state will be trigerred the message in `errorMsg.OVERLIMIT` will be shown. <br />

#### When Unbonding

User input cannot cause the total number of dots to be unbonded be greater than the number of dots they own. <br />
If the user attempts to unbond more Dots than they own, the error state will be trigerred the message in `errorMsg.OVERBONDED` will be shown. <br />
