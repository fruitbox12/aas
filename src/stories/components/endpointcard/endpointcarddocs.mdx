| `dotLimit`       | number       |                                                             |
| `dotsIssued`     | number       |                                                             |

NB: Most of these symbols are the exact same as the fields noted in the `Oracle` class found in `src/reducers/classes/oracledata.js`

## Expected Behavior

View is fluid. Restriced only by being palced within a container in a HOC.<br />
Viewports smaller than MUI's `md`, renders as a single column, and the bond buttons are hidden. <br />
Viewports larger than MUI's `md`, renders as dual column. <br />
Bond and un bond buttons show in the active palette's primary color. <br />
If the `oracleName` prop is not provided, the Link will be hidden. Otherwise it will be shown with a truncated version of the `oracleAddress` prop passed in.
