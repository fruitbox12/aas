# Particles

<br />

## Uses

Serves as the animated 3D background of `Hero`.
Serves as the container for the 3D assets.

## Children Components

_Currently_ imports assets from `src/views/pages/HomeView/3d/Sample.js`.

## Implementation

There is a transparent layer on top so that the `Hero` component does not get "lost" in the animation. 
The layer color is dictated by `theme.palette.background.dark` when using `makeStyles`.

## Expected Behavior

Resizes with the viewport for a seamless and mobile friendly experience.

## Rendered Example

[Just the Hero](?path=/story/views-pages-home-view-particles--alpha)

<Canvas>
   <Story id={"views-pages-home-view-particles--alpha"} />
</Canvas>
